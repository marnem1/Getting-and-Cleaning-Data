# Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains a file called `run_analysis.R` that cleans up the dataset given in the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data". 

The second file it contains called `CodeBook.md` gives a description of the variables present in the data as well as the transformations performed to tidy the data.
